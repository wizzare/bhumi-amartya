## [Unreleased]
 
## [4.0.0] - 2026-04-22
### Added

- **Sovereign Knowledge Engine**: Promoted the high-fidelity professional calculation engine as the global standard.
- **Enhanced Legal Headers**: Unified SPDX license identifiers across the entire codebase.
- **Advanced Forensic Reliability**: Integrated multi-stage validation for all planetary and mechanical calculations.

### Changed
- **Major Version Bump**: Shifted to v4.0.0 to signal the structural change in licensing and professional-grade stability.

## [3.4.1] - 2026-01-23
### Added
- **Deep Recursive Exclude**: Enhanced dot-notation support for `exclude` parameter up to 3+ levels (e.g., `["gates.personality.Sun"]`), ensuring full parity with whitelisting logic.

## [3.4.0] - 2026-01-22
### Added
- **Recursive Masking**: Upgraded `OutputMaskingService` to support dot-notation for nested fields in `include` and `exclude` parameters (e.g., `["gates.profile", "general.birth_place"]`).

## [3.3.2] - 2026-01-22
### Fixed
- **V2 Geocoding**: Fixed an edge case in `POST /v2/calculate` where explicit `0.0` coordinates were failing to trigger reverse geocoding fallback.
- **Test Parity**: Updated version assertion tests to align with `pyproject.toml` as the single source of truth.

## [3.3.1] - 2026-01-22
### Fixed
- **Docker Build**: Removed `*.sqlite` from `.dockerignore` to ensure the required `hd_data.sqlite` database is included in the Docker image.
- **Configuration**: Updated `.gitignore` to force-track `.dockerignore` changes.

## [3.3.0] - 2026-01-21
### Added
- **V2 Calculate API (10x Upgrade)**: Launched the high-fidelity `POST /v2/calculate` endpoint.
    - **Semantic Enrichment**: Direct lookup for full, human-readable descriptions of Incarnation Crosses, Centers, and Gates using a local SQLite architecture.
    - **Nested Hierarchy**: Restructured the response into a logical hierarchy: `general`, `centers`, `channels`, `variables`, `gates`, `advanced`.
    - **Advanced Mechanics**: Integrated **Dream Rave** (activated gates/centers) and **Global Cycles** (Cycle Cross/Great Cycle) directly into the API response.
    - **Fixations Explicit & Structural**: Semantic logic for gate/line fixations (Exaltation/Detriment) is now structural and machine-readable.
- **Test Stability**: Implemented coordinate-based test payloads for all composite and penta tests to bypass geocoding rate limits during high-frequency CLI verification.

### Fixed
- **Global Cycle 2027 Transition**: Resolved a timezone conversion bug where Jan 1st, 2027 births were incorrectly assigned to "Cross of Planning" due to UTC shift. Now uses input year for era determination.
- **V2 Schema Parity**: Achieved 100% semantic parity with V1 while maintaining V2's performance and design advantages.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-01-21
### Added

### Changed
- **Formatting**: Updated `/calculate` output to return expanded profile names (e.g., "4/6: Opportunist Role Model") instead of raw numbers.
- **Documentation**: Clarified `islive` parameter to indicate life status (True = Alive, False = Deceased).
- **Defaults**: Updated default values for `gender` (`male`) and `islive` (`true`) across all schemas and endpoints.
- **Refactoring**: Replaced deprecated `example` parameter with the modern `examples` list in all route definitions to eliminate `FastAPIDeprecationWarning`.
